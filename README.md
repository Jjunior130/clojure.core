# clojure.core

## Goals

* Reimplement clojure.lang package in Clojure
* Reimplement stdlib (clojure.core and associated) as modular components
* Make clojure.lang and clojure stdlib host agnostic
* Build a comprehensive test suite for Clojure
* Maintain as much backwards compatibility as possible

## Run the tests

```bash
$ lein test
```
