# clojure.core

## Goals

* Port the clojure.lang package to Clojure (Clojure-in-Clojure)
* Make Clojure stdlib reusable for all hosts, starting with the JVM and CLR.
* Build an executable specification for Clojure, in the same vein as the [RubySpec](http://rubyspec.org/).
* 100% backwards compatibility

## Run the tests

```bash
$ lein test
```
